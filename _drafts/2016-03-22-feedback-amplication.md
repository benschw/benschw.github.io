Quick feedback loops are a critical part of Agile development processes. The common
wisdom is that by implementing processes with rapidly repeating cycles it is possible
to learn from the frequent feedback and continually adapt and improve the process.
Quick feedback isn't enough however. Equally important is the quality of the feedback and what you do with it.

With an iterative and quickly repeating process, your feedback will naturally amplify over time.
By capturing the right feedback and paying attention to its amplitude,
you can more easily recognise signal.



This amplification effect isn't only beneficial for deriving signal. Sometimes
it is beneficial to leverage the process loop to amplify a certain behavior in order to
reinforce a habbit or build a new one



- feedback cycle for adaption v. amplification
- automate gathering the feedback you want to want to measure
	- what signal is important, not what is easy to quantify
- leverage fast cadence to form habits by adding behaviors to feedback cycle

Metric: feedback amplitude

## What is a feedback loop?
- CI / automated test
- CD
- pair programming, code reviews
- daily scrums, sprints

- 
## Why is quick feedback important?

## How does feedback produce amplification?

- Electrical Metaphore
- Software

## How are you already using amplification without knowing it?

- confidence in automation
- confidence in software quality
- confidence in UX
- prioritizing features/functionality

## Now that you know how it works, how can you use it to your advantage?

- capturing signal with metrics
- creating habits by associating behaviors with feedback cycle
