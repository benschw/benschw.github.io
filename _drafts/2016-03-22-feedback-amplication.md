intro

<!--more-->

- feedback cycle for adaption v. cmplification
- automate gathering the feedback you want to want to measure
	- what signal is important, not what is easy to quantify
- leverage fast cadence to form habits by adding behaviors to feedback cycle

Metric: feedback amplitude

## What is a feedback loop?

## Why is quick feedback important?

## How does feedback produce amplification?

- Electrical Metaphore
- Software

## How are you already using amplification without knowing it?

- confidence in automation
- confidence in software quality
- confidence in UX
- prioritizing features/functionality

## Now that you know how it works, how can you use it to your advantage?

- capturing signal with metrics
- creating habits by associating behaviors with feedback cycle
